##Instructions

git clone this repo and cd into the directory

in the root folder 'npm start' starts the client

'node server/server.js' will start the server.  

'npm test' will run some tests, a few basic ones I have written. I will continue and test the thunks for my own practice, but for now, this meets the requirements. 

cheers!
